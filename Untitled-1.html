	<p class="indent"> Fish Fillet: Shades of orange<br>
Chicken Fillet: Shades of purple<br>
Ham burgers: Shades of green<br>
	<br>
We can see from the above graph that from the menu options between Ham burger, Chicken Fillet and Fish Fillet Ham burgers are taking the lead in sales. We see a similar trend in sales with there being a peak in 2018 and then the sales dropping. 


	</p>
	<p class="indent">
Let us go into details of each individual products on the menu.
	</p>
	<center><img src="Chicken.png", style="width: 60%; height:40%;"></center>
	<p class="indent"> For chicken fillet we see that the sales are increasing from Jan-16 and reached a good point in March 18-May 18. There was a sharp drop in sales in Sep- 18. After that we can see that the sales are almost at the same. The different regions have the same kind of sales. </p>

	<center><img src="Fish.png", style = "width: 60%; height: 40%"></center>
	<p class="indent"> The fish fillet sales are similar like the chicken fillet in terms of pattern of the sales. </p>

	<center><img src="Ham.png", style = "width: 60%; height: 40%"></center>
	<p class="indent"> The sales of hamburgers are consistently increasing till a drop of sales in September 18. Then they are lower than before at almost the same level. </p>

	<center><img src="Daily.png", style = "width: 60%; height: 40%"></center>
	<p class="indent"> We see a difference between the sales between hamburgers and chicken and fish fillet to be very wide. The daily sales are quite consistent with no drops in sales. </p>

	<center><p class="sub">Success, Pitfalls and Methodology (Tips)</p></center>
	<p class="indent"> The methodology used for this was to make charts of the given data and see the pattern that the sales occur. The data was categorized according to different menu items and thus there were different charts that were made. The different charts are one which shows all the menu items on one chart to see the relative sales while the other charts are individual menu items so we can see the pattern of sales in each item. Daily sales are also included to see if there are differences on a daily basis. <br>
Already done research on impossible burgers is used to see if that can help the company increase its sales. <br>

The pitfalls are it is hard to make a website. I haven’t really made a website before, so I didn’t know the logistics to make one. I am kind familiar with the html tags so that was useful. <br>

The success of this project was we can kind of see the market for the burgers. Also I managed to make a website. 
	</p>

	<center><p class="sub">Conclusion</p></center>
	<p class="indent"> There are people who are changing to be vegans or there are more self-identified vegetarians with time changing. Considering that we don’t have any vegetarian and vegan friendly burgers on the menu Impossible burger would be the one that fills the gap between our vegetarian and vegan friends and the company. We can see from the above sales chart that the sales increased and didn’t stay there instead it dropped and then stayed at the dropped level. Thus, we can say that the drop in the sales and increase in vegetarian and vegan people can open a new category where people can get food at the restaurant. This opens a new category were we can earn revenue and make up for the loss in sales in the other categories. Also, seeing the popularity of impossible burger this new addition would benefit the sales. These changes would keep the shareholders happy. </p>
